Clean Architecture implementation with ASP.NET Core.

See: https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/

The approach is based of the _Onion Architecture_, which was mentioned by Jeffry Palermo back in 2008 in a blog posts. 
The architecture is intended to address the challenges faced with traditional architectures and the common problems like 
coupling and separation of concerns.

The basic solution structure can be used to build Domain-Driven Design (DDD)-based solution.
